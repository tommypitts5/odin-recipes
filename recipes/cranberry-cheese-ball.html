    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. </li>
            <img src="../img/cranberry-cheese-ball/stepone.webp" alt="Ingredients laid out on counter." width="200">
            <li>Bring cranberry juice just to a boil in a small saucepan. Remove from heat. Add 1/4 cup dried cranberries. Cover; set aside.</li>
            <img src="../img/cranberry-cheese-ball/steptwo.webp" alt="Cranberries in a saucepan." width="200">
            <li>Place cream cheese, Cheddar cheese, and butter in a large bowl. Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
            <img src="../img/cranberry-cheese-ball/stepthree.webp" alt="Cheese and butter in a glass bowl." width="200">
            <li>Drain cranberries, reserving 1 tablespoon juice. Add plumped cranberries and reserved juice to the bowl with the cheese mixture. Add 1 tablespoon chives, orange zest, brown sugar, and garlic powder. Beat with an electric mixer on medium until light and fluffy. </li>

            <li>Place cheese mixture on a sheet of plastic wrap. Use the plastic wrap to shape the mixture into a ball (it wonâ€™t be a perfect shape at this point). Wrap in the plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 3 to 24 hours.</li>

            <li>Now you can make a better ball shape by rolling the wrapped mixture on your work surface.</li>

            <li>Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup dried cranberries, remaining 1 tablespoon chives, and the pecans on a sheet of plastic wrap or waxed paper. Roll cheese ball in the mixture to coat.</li>

            <li>Let stand 15 minutes before serving with crackers, crostini, or vegetable dippers.</li>
